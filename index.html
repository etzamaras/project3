<p>Info on Yma Sumac:<br>
  Feeding the needs of an American music industry that often turned to Latin sounds when sales were down, Peruvian-born pop diva Yma Sumac burst onto the music scene in the early 1950s with something audiences outside Latin America had never before heard. <br>
  With her four-to-five-octave singing range, "exotic" identity, and mysterious origins that were the subject of urban legend, the so-called "Nightingale of the Andes" offered mid-century North American audiences with a break from the ordinary. <br>
  While the thrust of her commercial success was largely limited to the 1950s, Sumac's recordings and occasional concert tours also earned her a cult following among later generations, who would come to revere this "Inca princess" as a venerable queen of camp. <br>
  Beyond what is considered a normal soprano voice, Sumac comfortably inhabited the realm of a coloratura soprano, often embellishing her agile voice with imitations of birds or beasts. <br>
  Her versions of traditional Peruvian folk songs were further colored by elaborate orchestral treatments.<br>
  While there is some disagreement about the true range of her voice, Sumac was known to move comfortably from B below low C to A above high C (four and a half octaves), often reaching her trademark staccati high D's.<br>
  She claimed to cover five octaves, and attributed her ability to reach high notes to having been raised at a high altitude in Peru.<br>
